# OOP_S25
# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Spring 2025

## Course Overview
This repository documents my journey through the **Java Object-Oriented Programming** course at [Your Institution], taught by **Professor Gil Salu**. The course focused on core programming concepts using Java, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented design, problem-solving, and building real-world applications.

## Course Details
- **Instructor:** Professor Gil Salu  
- **Room:** HNS168  
- **Office Hours:** Tuesday & Thursday, 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM or by appointment  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)  
- **Textbook:** ZyBooks Early Objects  

## Topics Covered
Throughout the semester, we explored the following major topics:

### Weeks 1–5: Java Foundations
- Java syntax, primitive types, input/output
- Using math methods and expressions
- Working with objects and basic classes
- Conditional logic (if-else) and boolean expressions
- Loops: for, while, nested loops
- Designing custom classes and encapsulation

### Weeks 6–10: Intermediate Concepts
- Array creation, manipulation, and searching
- Algorithm development: sorting (insertion, selection, merge)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Recursion techniques
- Git and GitHub collaboration basics

### Weeks 11–12: Advanced Java & Applications
- Generics and the Java Collections Framework
- GUI development with Java Swing and JavaFX
- Event handling and building interactive Java applications

## Notable Labs & Assignments
- **Mad Lib Generator**: Practiced string manipulation and input/output.
- **Driving Cost Calculator**: Reinforced object use and simple methods.
- **BankAccount Class**: Implemented encapsulation and constructors.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Applied nested loops and array processing.
- **Grocery List Manager**: Explored linked lists and collections.
- **JavaFX Weather App**: Created a GUI with event-driven design.

## Assessments
- Weekly quizzes on core concepts
- Midterm: Coding challenges + multiple-choice
- Final GUI Project: Demonstrated JavaFX application with user interaction
- Regular participation in in-class and independent lab exercises

## Tools & Resources Used
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – for development and debugging
- **ZyBooks Early Objects** – for structured lessons and exercises
- **W3Schools Java** – supplemental learning
- **GitHub** – version control and collaboration

## Grading Breakdown
- In-Class Labs: 20%  
- Independent Labs: 30%  
- Quizzes: 25%  
- Challenging Labs: 5%  
- Midterm: 10%  
- Final Exam: 10%  

## Reflections
This semester built a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming. From basic syntax to recursion and GUI applications, the hands-on labs and structured assignments helped reinforce theoretical concepts through practice.
